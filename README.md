# EVM-Custom-Node-Precompile

## Project Goals

- Develop a Custom Precompile for EVM Nodes:
  - Extend the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) by adding a new precompile to the Geth (Go Ethereum) client.
  - Enhance the capabilities of the EVM to support specialized operations that improve performance.
- Optimize Rollup Performance:
  - Increase the throughput of Layer 2 solutions (rollups) by reducing computational overhead.
  - Enable faster transaction processing and lower gas csts for rollup operations.
- Enhance On-Chain Computation:
  - Provide more efficient execution of complex computations directly on-chain.
  - Improve the scalability and efficiency of smart contracts require intensive processing.

## Custom Precompile's Core Operations

- Batch Processing of Transactions
  - Process a batch of Layer 2 transactions in a single call to reduce the number of seperate transactions, saving both gas and processing time.
- Compression of Transaction Data:
  - Implement a function that compresses data before storing it on-chain, reducing the cost of storage and helping optimize rollup efficiency.
- Merkle Tree Proofs of Data Integity:
  - Add support for constructing or verifying Merkle trees directly in the precompile. This could improve rollup verification by quickly validating state changes.
- Matrix Multiplication or Cryptographic Operations:
  - Enable support for complex mathematical functions or cryptographic operations like elliptic curve pairing, reducing the need for such computations in regular EVM contracts.
