# EVM-Custom-Node-Precompile

## Project Goals

- Develop a Custom Precompile for EVM Nodes:
  - Extend the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) by adding a new precompile to the Geth (Go Ethereum) client.
  - Enhance the capabilities of the EVM to support specialized operations that improve performance.
- Optimize Rollup Performance:
  - Increase the throughput of Layer 2 solutions (rollups) by reducing computational overhead.
  - Enable faster transaction processing and lower gas csts for rollup operations.
- Enhance On-Chain Computation:
  - Provide more efficient execution of complex computations directly on-chain.
  - Improve the scalability and efficiency of smart contracts require intensive processing.
