# Core Operations Architecture and Design

## Batch Processing of Transactions

- Function: ProcessBatchTransactions
- Input: []Transaction, gas limit
- Output: BatchResult
- Data Types:
  - Transaction: Represents a single transaction.
  - BatchResult: Contains the result of processing the batch.
- Edge Cases:
  - Ensure individual transaction failures don't halt batch execution.
  - gas limits per transaction in batch.

## Compression of Transaction Data

- Function: CompressTransactionData
- Input: []byte
- Output: []byte
- Data Types:
  - CompressedData: Represents the compressed data.
- Edge cases:
  - Edge case for maximum byte length.
  - decompression validity.
  - compression ratio inefficiency checks.

## Merkle Tree Proofs of Data Integrity

- Function: VerifyMerkleProof
- Input: MerkleProof
- Output: bool
- Data Types:
  - MerkleProof: Contains the proof data for verification.
- Edge cases:
  - Empty proof paths.
  - invalid paths.
  - mismatches between leaf and root due to tampering.

## Matrix Multiplication or Cryptographic operations

- Function: PerformMatrixMultiplication
- Input: Matrix, Matrix
- Output: Matrix
- Data Types:
  - Matrix: Represents a mathematical matrix.
